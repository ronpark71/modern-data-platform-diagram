# modern-data-platform-diagram
My take on the latest modern data platform architecture.   

This data architecture is designed to support approximately 95% of modern data platform use cases across a wide range of industries.

While specific tools like Fivetran, Airflow, Kafka, and various BI platforms are referenced in the diagram, these technologies are interchangeable with equivalent alternatives depending on team preferences, budget, and ecosystem.

The one notable exception is dbt, which stands out as a uniquely impactful transformation layer. At present, no other tool combines version control, modular SQL modeling, and dependency-aware builds quite like dbt.

⚠️ Note: This diagram is comprehensive by design. Not all components are required for every use case — the optimal stack depends heavily on your specific data sources, scale, latency requirements, and business needs.
