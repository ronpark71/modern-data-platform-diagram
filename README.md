## 🎯 Purpose

This architecture reflects best practices for building **modern data platforms** using modular, interchangeable components — enabling data ingestion, transformation, governance, warehousing, and analytics at scale.

- Designed to solve ~95% of enterprise data use cases
- Easily portable across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**
- Highlights battle-tested components in the **modern data stack**
- Prioritizes **lineage**, **quality**, **performance**, and **team velocity**

---

## 🧠 Strategic Highlights
- Simplicity
- 🔄 **Modular design**: Technologies such as Fivetran, Kafka, and Airflow are representative but can be swapped based on your existing ecosystem or preferences
- 🧱 **dbt as a strategic core**: dbt uniquely empowers analytics engineering by integrating SQL modeling with software development best practices — version control, testing, documentation, and CI/CD
- ⚙️ **Flexible orchestration**: Supports both batch and real-time workloads, including event-driven architectures
- 📊 **Business-ready outputs**: Downstream flexibility to support a wide variety of BI and AI tools
